# Helm Values for MATLAB Parallel Server in Kubernetes

The following table lists the configurable Helm values that you can set in the YAML file you use to configure MATLAB Parallel Server in Kubernetes.
If you do not include a parameter in your YAML file, your configuration uses the default value.
